BBDiese is a library that transforms bbcode to html.

==== LICENSE ====
The code is in the Public Domain. See the LICENSE file for more details.

==== Motivation ====
 -- Lack of bbcode transformers publicly available for dotnet.
 -- Those that are available are not that smart, just an advanced
    search+replace scripts.
 -- BBDiese builds an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), ensuring that
    supplied bbcode is correct (no overlapping) along with produced html.
